A huge bug in CNContactViewController, when you use the Unknown Person variant.  It destroys the surrounding interface so that your app becomes useless; the user is stuck. See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32973254/cncontactviewcontroller-forunknowncontact-unusable-destroys-interface.

I believe this bug is confined to iOS 9 and that it was fixed starting in iOS 10 (though some report otherwise). But in any case it's a crippling bug so I'm leaving the example here, without updating it further.
